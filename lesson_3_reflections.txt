When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It makes it easier to collaborate with other programmers when you have your
    code hosted in a remote repository that they can access. With larger 
    programs, it prevents the code form taking up too much space on your hard
    drive. It's also accessible from anywhere that you can gain access to an
    internet connection more or less.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
